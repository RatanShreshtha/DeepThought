A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.

- It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.
- "Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
- "Hello, world!" is also used by computer hackers as a proof of concept that arbitrary code can be executed through an exploit where the system designers did not intend code to be executed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main( )
{
  printf("Hello, World!");
}
```

So here is my first blog post, the topics that I will be blogging about are going to be mostly related to programming, technology, gadgets, photography etc. Or maybe not, at this point I don't really know.
